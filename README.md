# NLP-to-predict-disaster-tweets
Created a model predicting which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. Implemented by cleaning the tweet text using regex and nltk python package.
Implemented techniques such as lemmatization and stemming to extract root words from the text. Performed PoS tagging using python spaCy package and vectorized the text data using Bag of Words (Count vectorizer) and TF-IDF vecotrizer. Modeled the clean text data using Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm and calculated the accuracy score for the model
