# NLP-to-predict-disaster-tweets
• Implemented a text classifier for categorization of tweets as being associated with any real disaster or not.

• Extracted insightful text data from a tweet data set using data wrangling techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization
and stemming from the python nltk package.

• Performed Part of speech (POS) tagging and Named-entity recognition (NER) on tokenized text to filter words relevant
to the classification scenario using the python spaCy package.

• Vectorized the processed text data using CountVectorizer (Bag of Words) and TfidfVectorizer (TF-IDF) tool from the
sklearn library and trained the data using MultinomialNB (Naive Bayes classifier).
